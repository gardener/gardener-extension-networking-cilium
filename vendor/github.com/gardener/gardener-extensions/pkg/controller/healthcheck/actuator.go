/*
	Each extension can register multiple HealthCheckActuator with various HealthChecks for checking the API Objects it deploys.
	Each NewActuator is responsible for a single extension resource (e.g Worker) - predicates can be defined for fine-grained control over which objects to watch.

    The HealthCheck Reconciler triggers the registered NewActuator to execute the health checks.
	After, the Reconciler writes Conditions to the extension resource. One condition per HealthConditionType (e.g multiple checks that contribute to the HealthConditionType XYZ result in one Condition with .type XYZ).
	To contribute to the Shoot's health, the Gardener/Gardenlet checks each extension for Conditions containing one of the following HealthConditionTypes: SystemComponentsHealthy, EveryNodeReady, ControlPlaneHealthy.
	However extensions are free to choose any healthCheckType.

	Generic HealthCheck functions for various API Objects are provided and can be reused.
	Many providers deploy helm charts via managed resources that are picked up by the resource-manager making sure that
	the helm chart is applied and all its components (Deployments, StatefulSets, DeamonSets, ...) are healthy.
	To integrate, the health check controller can also check the health of managed resources.

	More sophisticated checks should be implemented in the extension itself by using the HealthCheck interface.
